<h3> 
	<em>"Where does he spend his summers?"</em> <br><br>
A lover of literature and philosophy, He can often be found curled up with a book by Camus or Sartre, pondering the meaning of existence and the human condition. He is an avid reader of The New Yorker, and the pages of the magazine are often filled with his notes and musings.
<br><br>
As a musician, he spends much of his time honing his craft on his guitar, producing, and writing new songs. His room is adorned with posters of his favourite musicians, and his surf green jazzmaster is never far from reach.
<br><br>
He is deeply romantic in his views of love and relationships. He is a bit of a loner, but deeply loyal to the few friends he has. He is an idealist, believing in the beauty and goodness of people, despite evidence to the contrary.
<br><br>
He has a deep appreciation for the beauty of the world around him, from cityscapes to the art and culture. He is often found wandering the narrow streets of Saint Augustine, taking in the sights and sounds, and finding inspiration in the world around him.
<br><br>
But, His passions are often tempered by a fierce inner turmoil, the result of a bipolar disorder that has plagued him for years. He suffers from mood swings that swing between manic highs and depressive lows.
<br><br>
His highs are characterised by a boundless energy and a stream of creative ideas, which he channels into his music. He can stay up for days on end, composing and recording, driven by a sense of urgency to capture the fleeting inspiration before it disappears. But these highs were short-lived, and often followed by crushing lows, where he felt isolated and disconnected from the world.
<br><br>
He is a complex and sensitive soul, struggling with the duality of his nature. The constant flux of his emotions is a source of frustration and confusion. He often feels misunderstood, and the isolation that comes with his condition is a constant companion. 
<br><br>
Despite these struggles, he is determined to make something of his life.
